    "\n",
    "**Python environments**. In this course we will encourage students to do their Python work using either *Spyder* or *iPython notebook*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spyder is an interactive development environment (IDE) which has Graphical User Interface (GUI) very similar to Matlab, so it will immediatelly come naturally to anybody who previously used Matlab. But, even for those who have never heard of Matlab, Spyder provides a very pleasant environment to work with. It has several tiled windows where programmers can see the console to run their code, python (`.py`) file editor, as well as view variables and files. \n",
    "\n",
    "iPython notebook (often called Jupyter) is a web-based IDE which is run on a browser and allows programmers to write and run their code within a browser window and to also create html-like documents (`.ipynb`) that are a mix of code and nicely formatted comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anaconda**. We recommend students to start by installing `Anaconda` software on their own laptops or PCs (there are versions for Windows, OSX, and Linux) and use that software to start either Spyder or iPython notebook. *Anaconda* software can be downloaded for free from https://www.continuum.io/downloads. We advise installing Python 3 version for the purposes of this course. To install the software requires about 2GB of free disk space. Upon starting *Anaconda*, a window will pop up with several large icons. Clicking the *Launch* button on the *jupyter notebook* icon will launch iPython notebook. Clicking *Launch* button on the *spyder* icon will launch Spyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spyder** (reference: http://pythonhosted.org/spyder/). Let us launch Spyder. We recommend using *iPython console*. In the *iPython console* window, type `?` and press enter. You will see a quick introduction and overview of IPython's features. Try to red through it. Next, type `1+1` and press enter. As the result you should see the output `2`. That is it for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "**iPython Notebook** (reference: https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/notebook/notebook.html). Let us launch the *jupyter notebook*. You will see a list of files and folders visible from your root directory. Open file `CIS3715 (Temple - Spring 2020) PythonBasics.ipynb` from the folder where you saved it. Now, you will be able to see a version of this file that you can edit and run pieces of code from. You are advised to make a copy of this file (click *File->Make a Copy*) that you will edit and you can always switch back to the original file if needed."

In *Spyder*, you can paste any code from the above in a `.py` file, let us say `test.py`, save in the current directory and type `execfile(\"test.py\")` in the console.

For experienced programmers, Library reference and Language reference in https://docs.python.org/2.7/index.html describe almost all we need to know about Python and its standard modules, but those documents are a bit dense for beginners. It would probably take too much time for a typical student to learn Python by going through those references. Moreover, those references do not contain any information about non-standard library packages developed by a large number of volunteers around the world. The appeal and power of Python lies largely in those packagesFor example, some of those packages, such as `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` have become the standard tools of a modern data scientist. The question is how to proceed with learning Python and many of its important packages?  \n",
